These are just some R scripts that I've found useful for school or just saw them online as snippets and wanted to see how they work.

I have put them on my github for you guys to refer to if you get stuck in R programming related issues.

Feel free to fork and add things of your own and if i find them useful i might merge them as well:)

LOVE YOU!
(MY IMAGINARY GIRLFRIEND;)
